### ðŸ“Œ Code Generation Guidelines

- **Maximum file length: 350 lines of code**
- If the implementation exceeds this limit:
  - Split the code into **multiple files/modules**
  - Keep related functionality grouped in each file
- Always use modular design:
  - Expose necessary functions/classes in separate modules
  - Import and reuse them where needed
- Prioritize readability, maintainability, and separation of concerns
